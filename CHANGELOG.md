## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `--version` / `-V` CLI flag (reads from package.json)
- 5 version consistency tests

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Package health scores** — 0–100 composite score (activity + consistency + growth + stability) with A–F letter grades per package
- **Actionable advice engine** — severity-tagged advice cards (critical/warning/info/success) with urgency levels, specific action steps, and affected package lists
- **Yearly progress tracking** — persistent history layer accumulates monthly per-package and weekly portfolio aggregates; portfolio trend chart with per-registry stacking
- **Interactive charts** — seventh chart added (portfolio trend stacked area); existing charts gain click-to-drill-down and scroll zoom/pan
- `computeHealthScore()`, `generateActionableAdvice()`, `computeYearlyProgress()` inference APIs
- `stats.mine()` API and `--mine <username>` CLI flag for npm maintainer discovery

### Changed
- `inferPortfolio()` now returns `healthScores` and `actionableAdvice` fields
- Dashboard upgraded from six to seven interactive charts

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **AI inference engine** — zero-dependency, pure-math inference: forecast, anomaly detection, trend segmentation, seasonality, momentum scoring, recommendations
- **AI Inference Panel** in dashboard — portfolio momentum, risk score, 7-day forecast with confidence intervals, automated recommendations
- **Daily stats refresh** — CI workflow fetches stats daily at 06:00 UTC
- **Starlight handbook** — 8-page documentation site alongside landing page
- Dashboard UX polish: tab transitions, mobile hamburger nav, inference panel verification

### Fixed
- Docker Hub URL encoding for namespaced repos
- Stats snapshot preserved on fetch failure instead of zeroing out
- Stats snapshot committed back to repo after each fetch

### Changed
- CI pipeline added with paths-gated triggers
- Package tracking expanded (30+ new packages added)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Pulse AI co-pilot** — complete rewrite of the AI chat into a named personality ("Pulse") with sharp, warm, concise voice
- **Streaming voice synthesis** — voice starts speaking as sentences arrive from the LLM, not after the full response completes
- **Web search** — Wikipedia API (zero setup, CORS-enabled) and optional SearXNG local Docker for broader web results; smart intent detection skips portfolio questions
- **Voice output** — 4 voices via mcp-voice-soundboard (George/Narrator, Bella/Assistant, Emma/Storyteller, Michael/Announcer) with auto-speak toggle
- **Fullscreen mode** — distraction-free chat with keyboard shortcut
- **GitHub org data connector** — optional PAT for org-level context injection (repos, stars, languages)
- **Auto-speak toggle** — persisted in localStorage, speaks responses automatically when enabled

### Changed
- Dashboard upgraded from "Registry Assistant" to "Pulse AI co-pilot" with richer system prompt and portfolio-aware context
- Voice playback uses Web Audio API (AudioContext) for Chrome autoplay policy compliance
- README and landing page updated; translations refreshed for all 7 languages

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- Version bump for npm publish; MSIX desktop build

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Live refresh** — client-side fetch from npm and PyPI APIs with progress indicator, no rebuild needed
- **Export reports** — three-format dropdown (Executive PDF, LLM JSONL, Developer Markdown) with professional-quality output
- **Pulse panel redesign** — separated Established Movers (prev ≥ 50) from Emerging & New, added sparklines and executive summary

### Fixed
- Package discovery now reads full manifest (132 packages) instead of leaderboard subset (78)
- jsPDF CDN switched from cdnjs (empty 404 files) to jsdelivr
- PDF export rewrites emoji to colored bullet dots (Helvetica can't render emoji)
- Decliner deltas now show correct sign in Markdown export

### Changed
- Markdown export: right-aligned number columns, Top-5 concentration metric, trend labels, collapsible sparkline stats
- JSONL export: schema v2.0 envelope, nested scope/totals/health, mover signal classification, package velocity score
- No-data export UX: styled toast with Refresh-button pulse replaces raw alert()
- README updated with live refresh, export, and Pulse panel documentation
- Leaderboard cap raised from 100 to 250

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **AI chat assistant** — Ollama-powered Registry Assistant on the Home tab with RAG context injection, streaming responses, model selector, conversation memory (localStorage), typing indicator, and offline fallback
- **Six interactive charts** (Analytics tab) — 30-day trend (aggregate / per-registry / top-5 toggles), registry share (polar area), portfolio risk (distribution histogram + Gini & P90), top-10 momentum, velocity tracker with sparklines, and 30-day heatmap with spike detection (>2σ)
- **Smart growth engine** — baseline threshold (prev < 20 → "🚀 Emerging"), percentage cap (> 500% → "▲ 500%+"), and damped velocity formula `(curr − prev) / √(prev + k)` applied consistently across all 8 display surfaces
- **Actionable insights panel** — auto-generated recommendations and "Needs Attention" alerts for declining packages
- **Help tab** — human-friendly guide covering every tab, key concepts (smart growth, velocity, spike detection, health score, confidence badges), AI assistant tips, data pipeline diagram, companion tools, and useful links
- **Setup page enhancements** — portfolio editor with validation, registry-sync companion section (install / audit / plan commands, detection grid, external links), and updated pipeline hint
- **Chat loading UX** — animated progress bar, elapsed time counter, send button spinner, model pre-warming on connect
- **Tabbed dashboard** — Home, Analytics, Leaderboard, and Help tabs with hash-based navigation

### Fixed
- `formatGrowth()` scope bug — function was defined in the runtime-refresh IIFE but called inside the chart-init IIFE, causing a ReferenceError that crashed the Velocity Tracker and 30-Day Heatmap

### Changed
- Dashboard restructured from single-page into four-tab layout
- Executive snapshot upgraded with health score (0–100), Shannon diversity index, and composite metric cards
- Leaderboard trend column now uses smart growth badges instead of raw percentages
- Landing page updated to reflect AI-powered dashboard features

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-02

- WinUI 3 desktop app (MSIX) with WebView2 dashboard viewer — offline-capable with live stats refresh

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Executive snapshot now emits structured `narrativeLines` array (6 labeled rows with icons) alongside flat `narrative` string
- Each line includes richer context: runner-up package, delta counts, portfolio concentration verdict

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Executive snapshot: rich one-sentence narrative (registry lead, top package, top gainer with delta, concentration, data confidence)
- Growth Pulse panel: precomputed top gainers, decliners, newly active packages
- Data Health panel: per-registry coverage, confidence badges (ok/partial/missing), expandable error details
- Per-row 30-day sparklines in leaderboard (npm only, CSS-only)
- `manifestCounts`, `fetchedCounts`, `errorsByRegistry`, `confidence`, `narrative`, and `movers` fields in stats.json payload
- `isNew` flag on packages (prev7=0 && last7>0); `trendPct` set to null for new packages to avoid infinity display

### Changed
- Dashboard restructured into two-column Pulse layout (Growth + Ops) replacing standalone Top Movers
- Concentration metric replaces "Active registries" summary card
- Updated timestamp is now relative ("5m ago") with hover for exact UTC

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-01
